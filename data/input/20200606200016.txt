old reality is setting in for the GOP: The only thing standing between a serious electoral setback and a truly historic shellacking in November might be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's sprawling investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 elections.
It's easy to lose sight of this in the day-to-day Choose Your Own Misadventure cacophony of the Trump White House, but the Mueller investigation really is a guillotine blade set to decapitate the administration and congressional Republicans at any moment over the next six months. The White House knows it, which is probably why the president is yelling into the Twitter void about tariffs and trade wars as senior aides continue to disappear back into the private sector with the names of expensive lawyers stenciled on their palms. At this rate, the Trump administration is going to be like some sitcom that replaces every single cast member except the star and dares you not to notice.
