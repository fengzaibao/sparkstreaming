Shares in major European car makers fell on Monday following a threat by US President Trump to tax their vehicles.
Mr Trump said if the EU "wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on US companies... we will simply apply a tax on their cars".
The US is an important market for cars built in the country. US demand for British-built cars rose by 7% in 2017, with exports reaching almost 210,000, and the US is now the UK's second-largest trading partner after the EU, taking 15.7% of car exports.
